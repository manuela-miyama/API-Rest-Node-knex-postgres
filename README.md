YouTube Masterclass Knex - Teacher: Mayk Brito; student: Manuela Miyama

This Rest API, made with Node.js and knex (to make possible the usage of the PostgreSQL Database) is a generic system, developed during my studies, that allows you to CRUD users and projects, as well as utilize the relationships between users and products.

I hope you like it! :)
